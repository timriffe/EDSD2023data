[Session 1, Monday, Nov. 7, 9:30-13:30](https://timriffe.github.io/EDSD2023data/Session1)


The files called `Session1notes.Rmd`, `Session2notes.Rmd` and `Session3notes.Rmd` contain entirely different data examples than those included in the primary handouts, but that are meant to exercise the same skills. These might be used become featured as primary examples in future editions of the module.
